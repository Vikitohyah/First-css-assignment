    <h1 style="color: red;">Welcome to CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is one of the cornerstones of modern web development, empowering designers and developers to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works hand-in-hand with HTML to define the visual appearance of elements on a webpage, it describes how HTML elements should be displayed. CSS provides a wide array of styling options, from basic properties like color, font, and margin, to more advanced techniques such as animations, transitions, and responsive design. CSS has three major styling methods which are; Inline Styling sheets, Internal styling sheets and external styling sheets. One of the key features of CSS is its ability to apply styles across multiple pages through external style sheets, enhancing consistency and maintainability across a website. Selectors in CSS allow for precise targeting of elements, enabling developers to apply styles selectively or broadly as needed. In recent years, CSS has evolved rapidly with the introduction of CSS Grid and Flexbox, providing powerful layout mechanisms that simplify complex layouts and enable developers to create more dynamic and flexible designs. Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web developers, offering unparalleled control over the visual aspects of web pages and enabling the creation of immersive and engaging user experiences on the web.</p>
